Summary
With over 12 years of experience in Software Quality Engineering
and Test Automation, I specialize in designing and implementing
end-to-end automation frameworks and AI-driven QA strategies that
accelerate delivery and ensure accessibility, performance, and
quality across Web, Mobile, API, and Backend systems.
I’ve led testing initiatives through all phases of the Software
Development Life Cycle (SDLC), across both Agile and Waterfall
methodologies. My expertise spans manual, automated, and ADA
accessibility testing, ensuring each release aligns with WCAG 2.1/2.2
and Section 508 standards for inclusive digital experiences.
At Canoo Inc., I served as Interim QA Manager and Hiring Manager,
where I built a QA department from scratch, hired and trained
engineers, and transitioned the organization from manual to
automation-first testing.
I’m passionate about continuous improvement and DevOps
integration, leveraging tools such as Jenkins, GitHub, and Azure
DevOps for CI/CD automation. My experience includes mobile
testing (iOS & Android using Appium), API automation (Postman,
RestAssured), and backend validation using SQL. Currently, I serve
as a QA Automation Lead at Deloitte, focused on AI-enabled quality
engineering and accessibility intelligence for Fortune 500 clients.
Known for mentorship, leadership, and analytical problem-solving, I
foster collaboration between QA, development, and business teams
to deliver reliable, accessible, and scalable software.
